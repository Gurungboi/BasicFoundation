# Storyboard vs Swift UI

## Pros of Storyboard

**For beginner, it is easy to start with.
**Able to create a prototype app but without any line of codes, though it is just for visualisation.
**The storyboard object library has a vast collection of objects.
**Large community Support Network.


## Cons of Storyboard

**Storyboard corde is in an XML type format, which is difficult to resolve merge conflicts and cannot completely understand too.
**Autolayout issues which requires to work with all supporting devices size.
**As the number of screens keeps increasing the management of storyboards can become very chaotic and as it forms a complex web-like structure.

## Pros of Swift UI

**Single Framework for multiple iOS Platform (MacOS, iOS, iPad)
**Automatic Live Preview
**No Auto Layout issues
**The code is clean and simple
**Swift UI View component can be easily reusable, by creating small module files.
**It gives way to reactive programming by providing bindable objects.
**Using UIHositngController in Swift UI, it will allow us to use UiKit Components.


## Cons of Swift UI
**Supports only iOS 13+ and Xcode 11+
**Least component options in swift UI like in the storyboard object library, hence we will have to create custom views to fulfill requirements, eg: Search bar.
**It might be difficult for someone to switch from storyboard to swift UI as it is difficult to visualize the view hierarchy in the form of code.
**There is no direct way of migrating from storyboard to swift UI, it will require developer to continue the use of the storyboard for existing apps and in lower versions.
**Less Community Support
